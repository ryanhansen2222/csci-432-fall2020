# CSCI 432: Advanced Algorithm Topics, Fall 2020 #

This repository is for class materials for CSCI 432 in Fall 2020, taught by Prof. Fasy.

MSU Course Catalog Description: 
A rigorous examination of advanced
algorithms and data structures. Topics include average case analysis,
probabilistic algorithms, advanced graph problems and theory, distributed and
parallel programming.

From the Instructor: This course is NOT a programming class, and is not
structured like the 132 and 232 courses the precede it.  In this course, we will
do many proofs (especially using induction), and will be writing pseudo-code, not
code.

Prerequisites:
CSCI 246 (Discrete) and CSCI 232 (Data Structures and
Algorithms) are a prerequisite for this course.  
In particular, a student enrolled in CSCI 432
should be familiar with 
sorting and searching algorithms, big-Oh notation, 
basic recurrence relations,
heaps, queues, lists, hash tables,
proof by induction and by contradiction, and discrete probability.

## Course Outcomes and Objectives

This course introduces students to the analysis and design of computer
algorithms. In this course, students will:

* Analyze asymptotic time and space complexity of algorithms.
* Describe algorithmic design paradigms (including dynamic programming,
  greedy algorithms, divide and conquer) and explain when an algorithmic design
  situation calls for it.
* Apply methods of analysis (prove
  correctness, time/space complexity, termination) to new
  problems.
* Use and analyze major graph algorithms and data structures.
* Analyze algorithms from recent research publications.

## Accessing this Repo

The repository is set as public, so you can access all course materials easily.
I suggest creating a fork, so that you can use your fork to maintain your own
materials for this class.  See the resources section below for forking directions.

## Other Course Tools 

- Group discussions, questions, and announcements will be through Piazza.
- Homework will be graded on Gradescope.  All homework should be posted both in
  Gradescope and in D2L.

## Grading
Your grade for this class will be determined by:

- Homework (min 25 / max 50 points)
- Group Project (min 15 / max 30 points)
- Exams (min 0 / max 4 points)
- In-class Exercises (min 10 / max 25 points)
- Miscellaneous (min 0 / max 6 points)

* Yes ... that adds up to more than 100! This allows for you to adjust where you
  put your effort in the class.  Hopefully this will help you focus on
  practicing the skills, and not worrying about the point distribution.
* Minimum points indicate the minimum points necessary to pass the class.
* Maximum points indicate the maximum points allowed in that category.
* The grading for this class is based on a "no grading" policy.  The theory here
  is the more you practice, the better you will become!
* Homework: All assignments must be submitted by 23:59 on the due date. Late
  assignments will not be accepted.  The submission should be typeset in the
  template provided.  Each homework will be graded on the following scale:
  incomplete (-1), low pass (+0.5), pass (+1), high pass (+2).  
* Project: Groups will be assigned.  You will be creating a video presentation
  of a "modern" algorithm.
* Exams: We will give two oral exam questions throughout the semester.  You can
  choose to take one, both, or neither. Grading scale:  incomplete (0), low pass
  (+0.5), pass (+1), high pass (+2).  
* In-class Exercises: Each day that we have groupwork in class, you will get
  credit: not present in groupwork (-1), low pass (+0.5), pass (+1), high pass
  (+2).   (Note: for the first week, not present in groupwork will be zero
  points instead of -1).
* Miscellaneous: Opportunities to earn points by attending colloquia and other
  events will be announced in class and posted on the course website.  To earn
  the extra credit, you must attend the entire presentation and write a
  one-to-two page summary and reflection on the presentation(s).  For a list of
  EC assignments, see [extra-credit.md](extra-credit.md).  Credit will be: not
  attempted (0), low pass (+0.5), pass (+1), high pass (+2).

## Class Policies

### Policy on Class Attendance

Class attendance and participation is required, but attendance will not be taken. However, to submit in-class exercises, you must be in class on the day of the exercise.

### Policy on Collaboration
Collaboration is encouraged on all aspects of the class, except where explicitly 
forbidden. Note:

- All collaboration (who and what) must be clearly indicated in writing on
  anything turned in.  
- Homework may be solved collaboratively except as explicitly forbidden, but
  solutions must be written up **independently**.  This is best done by writing
  your solutions when not in a group setting.  Groups should be small enough
  that each member plays a significant role. 

### Zoom Classroom Etiquette

Please come to class prepared by reading and working on homework problems
throughout the week.  We welcome questions!  In the Zoom breakout rooms, we
expect that you are actively working on problems.  If needed, start your group
by recapping what was discussed right before going into the breakout room or
during the class perioud before.  If something is unclear, ask for a
clarification from your classmate.  If your group is unsure of what the task is,
please ask and do not sit idle!

### Withdrawing

After 15 October 2020, we will only support requests to withdraw from this course
with a ``W" grade if extraordinary personal circumstances exist.  If you are
considering withdrawing from this class, discussing this with me as early as
possible is advised.  Since this class involves a project, the decision to
withdraw must also be discussed with your group.

### Special Needs Information

If you have a documented disability for which you are or may be requesting an
accommodation(s), please contact both me and the office of Disabled Student
Services within the first two weeks of class.

### Diversity Statement

Montana State University considers the diversity of its students, faculty, and
staff to be a strength and critical to its educational mission. MSU expects
every member of the university community to contribute to an inclusive and
respectful culture for all in its classrooms, work environments, and at campus
events.  Dimensions of diversity can include sex, race, age, national origin,
ethnicity, gender identity and expression, intellectual and physical ability,
sexual orientation, income, faith and non-faith perspectives, socio-economic
status, political ideology, education, primary language, family status, military
experience, cognitive style, and communication style. The individual
intersection of these experiences and characteristics must be valued in our
community.

If there are aspects of the design, instruction, and/or experiences within this
course that result in barriers to your inclusion or accurate assessment of
achievement, please notify the instructor as soon as possible and/or contact
Disability Services or the Office of Institutional Equity.

### Taking a Class during the COVID-19 Pandemic

This class will be held synchronously online.  However, you (or your
family/friends) might become ill with COVID-19 or something else, which can make
even remote attendance difficult.  If this happens, please communicate with the
instructor as soon as possible to minimize impact on your academic experience.
Also, we welcome feedback throughout the semester about what is working well /
not working well with the online delivery.  Doing so will help this be a better
experience for all!

## MSU Policies

### Academic Integrity

The integrity of the academic process requires that credit be given where credit
is due. Accordingly, it is academic misconduct to present the ideas or works of
another as one's own work, or to permit another to present one's work without
customary and proper acknowledgment of authorship. Students may collaborate with
other students only as expressly permitted by the instructor. Students are
responsible for the honest completion and representation of their work, the
appropriate citation of sources and the respect and recognition of others'
academic endeavors.

Plagiarism will not be tolerated in this course. According to the Meriam-Webster
dictionary, plagiarism is `the act of using another person's words or ideas
without giving credit to that person.'  Proper credit means describing all
outside resources (conversations, websites, etc.), and explaining the extent to
which the resource was used.  Penalties for plagiarism at MSU include (but are
not limited to) failing the assignment, failing the class, or having your degree
revoked.  This is serious, so do not plagiarize.  Even inadvertent or
unintentional misuse or appropriation of another's work (such as relying heavily
on source material that is not expressly acknowledged) is considered plagiarism. 

By participating in this class, you agree to abide by the Student Code of
Conduct.  This includes the following academic expectations:

- be prompt and regular in attending classes;
- be well-prepared for classes;
- submit required assignments in a timely manner;
- take exams when scheduled, unless rescheduled under 310.01;
- act in a respectful manner toward other students and the instructor and in a
  way that does not detract from the learning experience; and
- make and keep appointments when necessary to meet with the instructor. 


## Drug and Alcohol Policies

Per the Code of Conduct for students, no student may come to class under the
influence of drugs or alcohol, as that would not be`Fostering a healthy, safe
and productive campus and community.`  See [Alcohol and Drug Policies
Website](http://www.montana.edu/deanofstudents/alcoholanddrugs.html) for more
information.  In particular, note:

As a federally-funded institution, we must adhere to all federal laws when it
comes to alcohol and drug use or distribution. This holds true for marijuana as
well. Using or distributing marijuana on or off campus is a violation of our
code of conduct even if a student has a medical card or comes from a state in
which marijuana is legal or has been decriminalized.

As noted, the University's alcohol and drug policies apply off campus. Using
drugs and/or alcohol and returning to your residence hall in a disruptive
fashion- either via odor, noise, destruction, etc- can lead to residence life
policy and alcohol or drug policy violations. Remember, not everyone wants to
hear or smell you.
