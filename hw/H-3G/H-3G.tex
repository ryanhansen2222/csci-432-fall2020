Your group should make at least five contributions to the Piazza board.  A
contribution can be either asking a relevant question, responding to another
student's question, responding to an instructor's question, or choosing a
question from Chapter 1 and attempting to solve it, then  describing where you
get stuck in answering it.

        describing what the input and output is.
    \item Describe, in paragraph form, the algorithm you propose.
    \item Provide this algorithm in the algorithm environment.
    \item Use a decrementing function to prove that the loop terminates.
    \item What is the loop invariant? Provide the proof.

Describe two different data structures that you can use to store a graph.
Please give a complete description (i.e., a response of ``an array'' will not
suffice).

What is the closed form of the following recurrence relations?  Use Master's
theorem to justify your answers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $T(n) = 16 T(n/4) + \Theta(n)$
    \item $T(n) = 2 T(n/2) + n \log{n}$
    \item $T(n) = 6 T(n/3) + n^2 \log{n}$
    \item $T(n) = 4 T(n/2) + n^2$
    \item $T(n) = 9 T(n/3) + n$
\end{enumerate}
Note: we assume that $T(1)=\Theta(1)$ whenever it is not explicitly given.

\emph{The skyline problem:} You are in Camden, NJ waiting for the ferry across the river to
get into Philadelphia, and are looking at the skyline.  You take a photo, and notice that each building
has the silhouette of a rectangle.  Suppose you  represent each building $b$ as a
triple $(x_b^{(1)},x_b^{(2)},y_b)$, where the building can be seen from $x_b^{(1)}$ to $x_b^{(2)}$
horizontally and has a height of $y_b$.  Let $\mathtt{rect(b)}$ be the set of
points inside this rectangle (including the boundary).  Let $\mathtt{buildings}$
be a set of $n$ such triples representing buildings. Design an algorithm that takes $\mathtt{buildings}$ as input, and
returns the skyline, where the skyline is a sequence of~$(x,y)$ coordinates
defining $\cup_{b \in \mathtt{buildings}} \mathtt{rect}(b)$.  The output should
start with $(\min_b{x_b^{(1)}},0)$ and end with $(\max_b{x_b^{(1)}},0)$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe the problem in your own words, including
        describing what the input and output is.
    \item Describe, in paragraph form, the algorithm you propose.
    \item Provide this algorithm in the algorithm environment.
    \item What is the runtime of your algorithm? If you do not know, either give
        the tightest bounds you know, or provide a decrementing function to show
        that it does terminate.
    \item Prove partial correctness (that if your algorithm terminates, it is
        correct).
\end{enumerate}
