# CSCI 432 Oral Exam

The oral exam will be two questions, one on each of the following:

* A proof of correctness using a loop invariant
* A dynamic program algorithm

You can choose to take one of the questions, neither, or both.  For each, you
will have 15 minutes.  I will ask questions for clarification, and provide
promts to help you if you are stuck.  I am looking to see how you approach the
problem, not necessarily if you have the answers right away.

If you are interested in taking the oral proof, please send me an email with
three potential meeting slots.  Although you can take the oral any day before 25
November, please email me to schedule a time on or before 10 November.  The
times that I am typically available are Mondays after 14:00 and Thursdays after
12:00.
