# CSCI 432 Project

## Overview

In this project, you will work in a group to collaborate to investigate an
algorithm from a "recent" conference or journal (note: most groups are 2-5
students; recent means within the last 15 years). Each
group will choose the topic on their own, and become experts on this algorithm.
In addition, they will take the paper that they found one step further
in the plus-one (+1) element of their project.

## Deadlines
All deadlines are by 23:59 Mountain time on the date given (except for the
in-class presentations and discussion). Although not mandatory, all teams are
encouraged
to meet with the instructor or the TA between the P-1
and P-3 deadlines.

* P-1: due 22 October.  Selection of algorithm, and identification of what the +1 element of your project will be: 
  Suggestions of ways to do a +1: improve the algorithm in some way (speed, clarity), 
  explain the analysis of the algorithm in a different way than provided in the paper, 
  provide a runtime analysis if there is none, compare it against two or three other 
  algorithms, walk through an example or two, explain the algorithm more clearly/concisely 
  than the original publication, thoroughly explaining one of their proofs, etc. You are
  free to be as creative as you want for your +1 element, but I highly suggest
  you discuss this with the instructor or TA before this deadline. Your +1 is going
  to be the focus of your video, so choose wisely.  The deliverable is an (up to) three-page 
  write-up identifying the problem, providing pseudo-code or short description
  of the algorithm, 
  and identifying your +1 element.  We highly suggest chatting or messaging the
  us before this deadline for preliminary feedback. 
* P-2: due 2 November. Demonstration of progress: Prepare a document outlining (a) what
  you have done so far and (b) what is left to be done.  The deliverable is a one-to-two 
  page write-up (submitted as a PDF). 5 points.
* P-3: 16 November.  Video presentations: Each group will 
  present their video in-class. You will have to introduce the video, and answer
  questions from fellow students. 
  In addition, each group member will turn in a one-page summary detailing their contributions,
  the strengths / weaknesses of their project, and explain one thing that would be
  done differently if you could do it again. 40 points for video, 5 points for
  personal reflection.
* P-4: 24 November.  Peer evaluation: Everyone will fill out a survey about each
  prohject Your group will be responsible for synthesizing the feedback for one
  of the other groups. You will not be graded on 
  how well your peers evaluate your project, but rather, how well you evaluate other projects.  
  The deliverable is a group report.

# Alaternate Project

Solve five of the following problems:

* Given a set S of size n and an integer k < n, find the k^th smallest element of
  S.
* Let S be a set of n real numbers and a real number x, give an
  algorithm to determine if there are two numbers in S that add to exactly x. 
* Given a graph G=(V,E) and an integer k, give an algorithm that returns the
  largest induced subgraph H of G such that all vertices have degre \geq k, or decides
  that no such algorithm exists.
* Design an algorithm to find a vertex in a connected, undirected graph whose
  remove does not disconnect teh graph.
* Let P be a convex polygon (represented as a sequence of vertices in cyclic
  order). Give an algorithm that takes P and a point p and determines if p is
  inside the polygon P.
* Given n points in the plane, compute the length of the shortest bitonic tour.
  That is, you must start with the leftmost point, go strictly right until you
  reach the rightmost point, then go striclty left until you reach the leftmost
  point, then stop.
* Chapter 3, Problem 43 (Mind Reading)
* Chapter 4, Problem 23a (Climbing)
* Chapter 8, Problem 14 (Twitbook)
* Chapter 11, Problem 22 (Largest rooted common subgraph)

The solutions you provide are expected to beat brute-force.

* P-1: due 22 October. At this point, you should have selected the five problems
  that you want to work on.  You are welcome to discuss these problems with
  whomever you want, but the write-up must be your own.  For this deliverable,
  please get feedback from a peer on your statement of the problem for at least
  one of the problems.  Provide your problem description before and after the
  feedback, and give a brief summary of what you changed and why.
* P-2: due 2 November. At this point, you should have a draft of at least two of
  your solutions.  For this deliverable, get feedback on one of the
  presentations of the prose description of your algorihtm and/or the pseucode.
  Provide your algorithm description before and after the feedback, and give a
  brief summary of what you changed and why.
* P-3: due 16 November. By this point, you should know how to solve each of the
  problems and you shoul have most of it written up.  For this deliverable, get
  feedback on one of your proofs (either of termination, runtime, or partial
  correctness).  Provide your proof before and after the feedback, and give a
  brief summary of what you changed and why.
* P-4: due 20 November. Subit your solution to all five algorithms. In addition,
  please write a one-page reflection descirbing what you learned about your
  writing along the way.

Note: for peer feedback:

* You can choose someone you trust.
* You can request that we partner you with someone in the class.
* You can attend the Thursday writing workshops (10:00-11:00).  Please email
  Prof. Fasy if you would like this option.
